Recipes Project

This project is my first html project. 
It will showcase my current understanding of html and make use of links, directories, images, lists and such.

Three recipes html files were created. Recipe files showcased the use of relative links, ordered/unordered lists, paragraphs, absolute linking of images. 

Index file with relative links to the recipes was created. 

Also practiced staging, commits and push to GitHub using Git.
